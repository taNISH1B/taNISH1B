- 👋 Hi, I’m tanish
- 👀 I’m interested in front end and back end programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science at the university of saskatchewan.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different types of student groups which would help me grow as a programmer.
- 📫 If there are any creative student groups for programming mail me at tanishreddy46@gmail.com
